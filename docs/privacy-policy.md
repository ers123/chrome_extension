# Tab Nudge Privacy Policy (Draft)

_Last updated: November 17, 2025_

Tab Nudge operates entirely in the browser. It does not transmit personal data to external servers.

## Data Collection
- Tab metadata (URLs, titles) is accessed locally to provide tab management actions.
- No data is sent off-device or stored on remote servers.
- IndexedDB is used locally for usage metrics; data remains on your machine.

## Permissions Justification
- `tabs`: Required to count, group, and close tabs you select.
- `storage`: Saves your settings (thresholds, cooldowns, preferences) locally.
- `notifications`: Shows threshold alerts with action buttons.
- `alarms`: Schedules snooze timers.
- `sessions`: Restores recently closed tabs for the undo window.

## Data Sharing
- No data is sold, rented, or shared with third parties.

## User Controls
- All features are optional and configurable in the Options page.
- You can clear local data anytime via Chrome’s site data controls.
