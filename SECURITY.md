# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Tab Nudge is a single Chrome extension distributed via the Chrome Web Store.
Only the latest version published in the Web Store is actively supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue:

- Do **not** open a public GitHub issue with sensitive details.
- Email the maintainer or open a minimal GitHub issue asking for a private contact channel.
- Include:
  - A clear description of the problem
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Impact assessment (what could an attacker do?)
  - Any suggested mitigations

I will review security reports as quickly as possible and, if confirmed, aim to ship a patched version to the Chrome Web Store promptly.

## Data Handling

Tab Nudge is designed to operate locally in your browser without sending data to external servers. See `docs/privacy-policy.md` for more detail.
